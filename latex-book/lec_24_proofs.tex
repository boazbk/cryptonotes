\emph{Proofs} have captured human imagination for thousands of years,
ever since the publication of Euclid's \emph{Elements}, a book second

Plan:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Proofs and algorithms
\item
  Interactive proofs
\item
  Zero knowledge proofs
\item
  Propositions as types, Coq and other proof assistants.
\end{itemize}
